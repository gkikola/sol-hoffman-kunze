\section{Subspaces}

\Exercise1 Which of the following sets of vectors
$\alpha = (a_1,\dots,a_n)$ in $R^n$ are subspaces of $R^n$ ($n\geq3$)?
\begin{enumerate}
\item all $\alpha$ such that $a_1\geq0$
  \begin{solution}
    This is not a subspace since it is not closed under scalar
    multiplication (take any negative scalar).
  \end{solution}
\item all $\alpha$ such that $a_1 + 3a_2 = a_3$
  \begin{solution}
    This is a subspace: Let $\beta = (b_1,b_2,\dots,b_n)$. Then
    consider the vector $c\alpha + \beta$. We have
    \begin{align*}
      (ca_1 + b_1) + 3(ca_2 + b_2)
      &= c(a_1 + 3a_2) + (b_1 + 3b_2) \\
      &= ca_3 + b_3.
    \end{align*}
    Therefore $c\alpha + \beta$ is in the subset, so it is a subspace
    by Theorem~1.
  \end{solution}
\item all $\alpha$ such that $a_2 = a_1^2$
  \begin{solution}
    This is not a subspace since it is not closed under vector
    addition. For example, $(1, 1, 1, \dots)$ is in the set, but the
    sum of this vector with itself is not.
  \end{solution}
\item all $\alpha$ such that $a_1a_2 = 0$
  \begin{solution}
    This is not a subspace since it is not closed under vector
    addition. For example $(1,0,\dots)$ and $(0,1,\dots)$ are each in
    the set, but their sum is not.
  \end{solution}
\item all $\alpha$ such that $a_2$ is rational
  \begin{solution}
    This is not a subspace because it is not closed under scalar
    multiplication: Multiplication of any vector in the set having
    $a_2\neq0$ by an irrational scalar produces a vector that is not
    in the set.
  \end{solution}
\end{enumerate}

\Exercise2 Let $V$ be the (real) vector space of all functions $f$
from $R$ into $R$. Which of the following sets of functions are
subspaces of $V$?
\begin{enumerate}
\item all $f$ such that $f(x^2) = f(x)^2$
  \begin{solution}
    The functions $f$ and $g$ given by
    \begin{equation*}
      f(x) = x \quad\text{and}\quad g(x) = 1
    \end{equation*}
    each belong to this set, but their sum $f + g$ does not. Therefore
    this is not a subspace.
  \end{solution}
\item all $f$ such that $f(0) = f(1)$
  \begin{solution}
    Suppose $f$ and $g$ both belong to this set. Then
    \begin{align*}
      (cf + g)(0) &= cf(0) + g(0) \\
                  &= cf(1) + g(1) \\
                  &= (cf + g)(1),
    \end{align*}
    so the set satisfies the subspace criterion of Theorem~1 and is
    thus a subspace of $V$.
  \end{solution}
\item all $f$ such that $f(3) = 1 + f(-5)$
  \begin{solution}
    Take any $f$ and $g$ in this set. Then
    \begin{equation*}
      (f + g)(3) = f(3) + g(3) = 2 + (f + g)(-5),
    \end{equation*}
    which does not belong to the set. Therefore this set is not a
    subspace.
  \end{solution}
\item all $f$ such that $f(-1) = 0$
  \begin{solution}
    Let $f$ and $g$ be such functions. Then
    \begin{equation*}
      (cf + g)(-1) = cf(-1) + g(-1) = 0 + 0 = 0,
    \end{equation*}
    so this set is a subspace of $V$ by Theorem~1.
  \end{solution}
\item all $f$ which are continuous
  \begin{solution}
    If $f$ and $g$ are continuous, then $cf + g$ is also continuous,
    so this is a subspace.
  \end{solution}
\end{enumerate}
