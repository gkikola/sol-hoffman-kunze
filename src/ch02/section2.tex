\section{Subspaces}

\Exercise1 Which of the following sets of vectors
$\alpha = (a_1,\dots,a_n)$ in $R^n$ are subspaces of $R^n$ ($n\geq3$)?
\begin{enumerate}
\item all $\alpha$ such that $a_1\geq0$
  \begin{solution}
    This is not a subspace since it is not closed under scalar
    multiplication (take any negative scalar).
  \end{solution}
\item all $\alpha$ such that $a_1 + 3a_2 = a_3$
  \begin{solution}
    This is a subspace: Let $\beta = (b_1,b_2,\dots,b_n)$. Then
    consider the vector $c\alpha + \beta$. We have
    \begin{align*}
      (ca_1 + b_1) + 3(ca_2 + b_2)
      &= c(a_1 + 3a_2) + (b_1 + 3b_2) \\
      &= ca_3 + b_3.
    \end{align*}
    Therefore $c\alpha + \beta$ is in the subset, so it is a subspace
    by Theorem~1.
  \end{solution}
\item all $\alpha$ such that $a_2 = a_1^2$
  \begin{solution}
    This is not a subspace since it is not closed under vector
    addition. For example, $(1, 1, 1, \dots)$ is in the set, but the
    sum of this vector with itself is not.
  \end{solution}
\item all $\alpha$ such that $a_1a_2 = 0$
  \begin{solution}
    This is not a subspace since it is not closed under vector
    addition. For example $(1,0,\dots)$ and $(0,1,\dots)$ are each in
    the set, but their sum is not.
  \end{solution}
\item all $\alpha$ such that $a_2$ is rational
  \begin{solution}
    This is not a subspace because it is not closed under scalar
    multiplication: Multiplication of any vector in the set having
    $a_2\neq0$ by an irrational scalar produces a vector that is not
    in the set.
  \end{solution}
\end{enumerate}
